# Customer Satisfaction Prediction for Food Delivery Service

This project is designed to help a food delivery company improve customer satisfaction by analyzing survey responses. The company conducts a survey with six questions, each rated on a scale from 1 to 5 (where a higher number indicates a more positive response). Additionally, customers indicate whether they are happy with the service by responding with a simple yes or no. The dataset includes responses from 126 customers, with nearly half reporting that they are unhappy with the service.

## Project Overview

The goals of this project are:

1. Predict whether a customer is happy with the service based on their responses to the survey questions.
2. Identify which of the six survey questions are the best predictors of customer happiness, allowing the company to focus on the most impactful areas for improvement.

## Business Impact

1. App Improvement: The findings will suggest ways to enhance the app to convert unhappy customers into happy ones.
2. Survey Optimization: By identifying the most important questions, the company can reduce the length of the survey, making it easier to distribute and collect at scale.

## Machine Learning Models

The project evaluates various machine learning models to determine which model best predicts customer happiness based on their survey responses. The selected model inputs the most important survey questions and outputs a prediction of whether a customer is happy.

## Installation
